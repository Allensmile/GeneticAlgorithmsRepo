Genetic Algorithms in Python. 

### Objective Function Maximization
**function_maximize.py** takes an objective function of two variables and samples a population of points evolving to find the maxima of this function. 

The population undergoes random mutations - and is selected through elitism along with breeding with selection weights 
inversely proportional to fitness and diversity ranks.  

Included are surface plots of the function, initial population and final population graphs, as well as line plots of mean population fitness 
and L1 diversity through the iterations.
